## How to get books?
### Method â… 
Use bit torrent to get the books.  
The torrent file will be in the repo.
### Method â…¡
Use *Resilio Sync* to get books.
> Resilio Sync by Resilio, Inc. is a proprietary peer-to-peer file synchronization tool. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet via a modified version of the BitTorrent protocol. 
>   
> Resilio Sync synchronizes files using BitTorrent. The user's data is stored on the user's local device instead of in a "cloud", therefore requiring at least two user devices, or "nodes," to be online to synchronize files between them. Resilio Sync encrypts data with an Advanced Encryption Standard AES-128 key in counter mode which may either be randomly generated or set by the user. This key is derived from a "secret" which can be shared to other users to share data. Data is sent between devices directly unless the target device is unreachable (e.g. behind a firewall), in which case the data will first be relayed via an intermediary node. Many devices can be connected simultaneously and files shared between them in a mesh networking topology.  

* So, first download and install Resilio Sync(I'll also put a installer in the repo): https://www.resilio.com/individuals/
* The sync key is in the key.txt
